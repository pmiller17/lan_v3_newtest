==============

redone SociaLite code with the aim being easier to read, mode modular code.  The main code should be easy to read based on clear function names, organization, and brevity.  Source files will describe functions in more detail.  Very few 'extern' variables should be needed, and instead functions can get values and return them to the main file.  Some dependencies will be unavoidable, largely when dealing with hardware-specific macros that are mostly in the setup.
